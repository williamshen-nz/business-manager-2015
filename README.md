# Business Manager
This project was mainly for my A-Level Computing Project 2015, which I scored top in New Zealand in with an A* grade.

The Business Manager was also submitted to the Brightsparks Technology Awards 2015, and my project was accepted as a Finalist in the Senior Software Development Category.

## How to Use
Read the PDF files to understand how to use the program and how it was designed. Please forgive me for using Visual Basic -  it was the preferred language at my high school...

**src** - contains source files  
**install** - contains installable .exe file

The program also requires a pre-configured Access database to work properly. I will push one to GitHub as soon as I find one.

### Languages Used

 - **Visual Basic .NET** -  for GUI, handling data, essentially everything
 - **SQL** - used for writing the queries required to read, write and update the database
 - **C++** -  for printing documents and data

### Potential Improvements
There are many potential improvements for the future. The main improvement is rebuilding everything so the solution is online and can be accessed as a web application. The whole application is essentially a data storage, viewing and editing facility with a few advanced features.

Also, data viewing could be improved and a DBMS that is not Access **should** be used (e.g. Postgres). If you are interested in improving the business manager please get in contact with me! :)

### Other
I created this program with basic knowledge of how to program/code properly, so some of the code may be a bit convoluted.  Also, if you're interested, check out my website [here](https://shen.nz/).
